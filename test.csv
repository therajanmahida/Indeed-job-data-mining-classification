"Position Overview:

Sutter Health Design & Innovation is hiring a senior software engineer to break the patterns of our broken healthcare system.
ABOUT THE JOB
You'll be building and delivering features at a fast pace, working on greenfield projects. You’ll make healthcare more human, not less, with tech that is powerful, yet coy. This is an opportunity to work for social good and make a contribution to programs that raise the health status of the communities we live in.
As part of the Design & Innovation team, you can expect to grow in your strengths, alongside an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you every step of the way. You will work with a diverse team that includes business leaders, software engineers, data scientists, designers, researchers, and product managers to create useful and elegant solutions.
ABOUT US
Sutter Health is one of the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare systems, serving 3 million patients across 25 hospitals and hundreds of outpatient facilities in Northern California. The Design & Innovation team moves fast, and has the feel of a small startup within a large organization. We are perpetually curious about people, and that empathy fuels our work.
Ambitious and speedy (by design), we are a build-first island within a buy-first culture. We are creating a portfolio of software projects, with the intent to graduate the best ideas and abandon unsuccessful experiments. Here are some real examples of our recent work to familiarize yourself with what the job entails:
Web-based interface for care teams to collaboratively manage SMS conversations with patients.
Automated, SMS-based surveys to onboard patients and track their health progress.
Remote monitoring dashboard of sleep data for health coaches to support patients form good sleep habits.
Our tech stack is, for now, Ruby on Rails, Stimulus.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Heroku, Twilio, Auth0.
ABOUT YOU (AND US TOO)
You are a generalist, lifelong learner and you love it. You embrace ambiguity, with an owner’s mentality to decision making. You tilt toward action, threading the needle between analysis-paralysis and urgency. Your M.O. is pattern matching, and you’re always vigilant for perfect storm moments that breakthrough all the roadblocks. And by default, you laugh loud and often.
We want you to contribute uniquely and foster increasing heterogeneity within the team. We know that diversity of experiences, talents and identities create the strongest teams, and we’re ready for the continuous commitment required to build such an inclusive environment.
We might not always agree but we always value each other’s opinion. Everyone deserves to be heard, and in the end it is not about winning, it is about challenging each other, weighing the pros and cons of each solution and committing to do good work in the best interest of our users, both patients and providers alike.
We are a healthcare company first. That means we honor our personal health first and are committed to creating a workplace that supports a sustainable, healthy work/life balance. You can expect smiles and laughs and celebrations of success and kudos. You can expect a normal 40 hour work week. You can expect 8 hours of sleep. You are not joining a ‘work hard, play hard’ team. Ours is a ‘work smart, create awesome things’ culture.
We are a remote-work team, but we strive to replicate the camaraderie and serendipitous moments that in-person teams naturally enjoy. Therefore, we all commit to working a daily 4-hour overlap. Outside of that, you choose the start and stop times that make you the most productive and effective colleague.

Qualifications:

QUALIFICATIONS Bachelor’s degree in EE/CE/CS or equivalent education 6+ years of experience as a software engineer Familiarity with human-centered design

Healthcare experience is highly desirable but not absolutely required.
BENEFITS
Benefits at Sutter are designed for your health first. We offer PPO plans for both medical and dental. Other benefits include vision, life insurance, long-term disability and retirement plans.

"Growth Team, Sofia

At ClaimCompass, we’re looking for Full-stack Software Developers to join our internal Growth Team and help us reach new skies. If you’re looking for an exciting place to work, while constantly learning and becoming a better human, read on.



Things You Will Do

In layman’s terms, your challenge is to help as many passengers as possible experience the core value of ClaimCompass.


In more specific terms, you will

Write code for new features for our consumer facing line of products

Participate in the design and deployment of tests and experiments, which seek to improve a specific metric

Continuously improve our code, ensuring that it can sustain rapid experimentation

Dig through data to evaluate potential of ideas and help come up with new ones to hit the Growth Team’s objectives



About You

You understand code as a means to an end. What this means in practice is that you obsess over how well you’re solving our users’ problems and not the latest web development framework.

You ruthlessly prioritize your work. You always know that what you’re working on is of highest priority because it directly contributes to hitting your team’s objectives, rather than a shiny new feature, which is essentially a “nice to have”.

You are a perfectionist when it comes to writing code. You worship clean code and you’re a unit test fanatic because you clearly understand the value they bring to a team’s productivity.

You love to learn, because you will be tasked with things that you haven’t seen before and you’ll face problems that possibly no one on your team has come across in the past and you’ll have to figure them out.

About ClaimCompass

While a lot of industries have made significant progress, air travel appears to be moving in the opposite direction. Every day, millions of passengers like yourself are left dealing with flight delays, cancellations and disruptions of various magnitudes.

Our vision is simple: make air travel suck less.

We’re building a company, which seeks to bring excitement and delight back into flying, mostly when things don’t go as planned. Using data and tech, we seek to handle flight disruptions as they occur, predicting delays and cancellations, as well as processing claims and providing fair compensation to passengers where it is due.

As a relatively young team, we have a long way to go. In essence, this means that while we make one thing work, we sometimes break another. To some this may seem reckless, irresponsible, “no way to run a business”. But nothing counts to us more than the end result, and when we set ambitious goals, we’re bound to make mistakes - so long as we keep learning and delivering, we see no reason to change our philosophy.

That being said, working at ClaimCompass isn’t for everyone. This is the place for you if you’re not only capable, but thrive in a fast-paced environment, while being involved in numerous projects simultaneously, with shifting priorities, constantly evolving specifications and no clear procedural guidance. Your decisions WILL eventually have a direct impact on the business and you must be comfortable bearing this responsibility.

About The Growth Team

Make no mistake, every team at ClaimCompass is amazing.

But let’s talk about the Growth Team.


The main objective behind this relatively small, currently 6-people team, is to drive, you guessed it - growth. The way this happens is by working on a variety of different things - improving or developing new features in the current line of products, testing bold assumptions and moonshot ideas, experimenting with alternative revenue streams, etc. Essentially, you will be working alongside with great engineers and marketers.

What Technical Skills Do You Need?

To be successful in this role, you need to have a good understanding of Code Quality, Design Patterns and Algorithms. Preferably, you would have built side projects or professionally worked with libraries such as Node.js, React, Angular, LESS, SASS, etc.

You need to be able to demonstrate a good understanding of how software works under the hood, both on the front-end and back-end. That being said, our core products are written in React and powered by a Node.js + MongoDB back end, and we also use Docker and Kubernetes in our workflow, so you can expect to be working with these technologies most of the time.

We are also big fans of shipping to production daily and developing using feature flags. Most of the new features we develop are usually split tested.

If you don’t have experience working with some or all of the above, don’t give up - we still want to hear from you! Your mindset and aptitudes are much more valuable to us than a long list of buzzwords on your resume. Tell us more about a time when you’ve made a major impact at your current or previous roles, or a side project that you’ve worked on."

How we work

Happy Customers > Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be ""pure.""

Vision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee - these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.

Writing > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.

What we're looking for

We'd particularly like to get to know you if:

you communicate with clarity and precision. We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.
you're passionate, even if it's not about analytics. There should be something you know more about than anyone on our team.
you've written 10,000 lines of code that look embarrassing in retrospect. ... and you've written 10,000 lines of good code since then.
you like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes. We aren't robots.
What we're building

Under the hood, Heap is powered by node.js, Scala, Spark, ZooKeeper, Kafka, and CitusDB. Our app-layer stack is TypeScript, React, mobx, Redis, and PostgreSQL.

We're working on:

Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies. We also support materializing massive retroactive datasets into our customers' cloud data warehouses. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.
Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe). All of this has to happen with virtually no performance cost or integration overhead.
Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.

Our HQ is in SF, and we have an office in New York, but a large part of our engineering team is remote. We cover relocation costs, and can sponsor visas. We'd love to hear from you, no matter where you are!

Heap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.

People are what make Heap awesome. Regardless of age, education, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any personal characteristics, we want everyone to feel welcome. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive equal opportunity workplace everyone can call home."

"The Company You’ll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You’ll Work With

This role is on the Financial Reporting team within our Corporations Business Unit. We are the flagship product of Carta and we provide Equity Plan Management for Private and Public companies. Today, our team manages upwards of 1 trillion of equity!

The Financial Reporting team is a collaborative and passionate group of professionals that includes product managers, engineers, designers, customer support and sales. We’re united by a common mission to create more owners and simplify equity management. We place a high premium on experimentation and validated learning and we focus on being values and mission-driven, not didactic or prescriptive.

The Problems You’ll Solve

Some of the problems you would be helping us solve are:

Report data freshness, work in our infrastructure and data pipeline to get almost real time, fresh data on our reports.
Maintain our Financial reporting user experience suite, building intuitive and easy to use interfaces.
Data accuracy; guarantee data consistency in our financial reports
Service migrations from thrift to gRPC
Architecture and design of the financial reporting data pipeline
Scope and define tasks and stories for development
Lead customer migration to the next generation of Carta’s financial reporting platform
The Impact You’ll Have

You’ll help deliver a reliable and scalable reporting solution that will enable our largest and most valuable customers to grow on the Carta platform, providing them with audit-defensible financial reports.

Successfully releasing and migrating customers from our previous tools, you will improve our customer's experience and trust in the Carta platform. This reporting solution will also reduce the amount of internal support required for this area of our product.

You'll move the Carta platform forward by adopting technologies such as Kafka and gRPC that will unlock future milestones.

About You

You have 3+ years of fullstack or backend engineering experience building scalable, production quality systems. You have strong communication skills and enjoy working with business stakeholders to understand business requirements. Together, you build thoughtful solutions. You’re passionate about FinTech and helping our customers empower their employees to understand and value their equity.

Our tech stack is Python, Django, React, Postgres and Scala. Prior experience with these technologies is ideal, but not required. We have people in our team who will help you figure it out, grow your skills and help you learn - and ideally, learn from you too. We believe in transparent learning without ego.

The Interview Process

Our team believes that interviews are a two-way process and we strive to make them enjoyable without any “gotchas.” The interview process starts with a call with a member of our warm, amazing recruiting team who will tell you more about the job and the company. Then, you’ll meet the engineering manager for the Financial Reporting team, Luis, who will walk you through the specifics of the position, the team structure, what we’re looking for, and of course, answer any questions you will have. This interview will last 30 minutes. Then, there’s a technical screen where you’ll have the choice of a Codility take-home assignment or being paired with one of the engineers on the Financial Reporting team for a 60 minute pair programming exercise. Finally, we will schedule you for another four to five meetings with other team members to discuss everything from coding and design to Carta’s culture to cross-team collaboration and what you can expect, and what is expected from you.


We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.

"In 2013, our founding team recognized the lack of smart terminals in the market, so we set about reimagining the ubiquitous payment terminal into a connected, multi-purpose device that runs third-party apps.

As smart terminals become mainstream, Poynt OS sets the standard as the open operating system that can power any smart payment terminal worldwide. Combined with our Apps ecosystem we are creating a new app economy for merchants and allowing developers to write once and distribute everywhere.

Fueling our growth are some of the Valley’s top VC firms and leading global payments and fintech companies including Elavon, Google Ventures, Matrix Partners, National Australia Bank, NYCA Partners, Oak HC/FT Partners, Stanford-StartX Fund, and Webb Investment Network.

Headquartered in the heart of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, CA, with offices in India and Singapore, we’re growing rapidly on a global scale so that merchants worldwide have the technology to transform their business.

About the Role

We live and breathe Android at Poynt. Our fork of the Android operating system runs on every single one of our payment terminals, and we build both the core apps that ship to all our merchants as well as SDKs that support all the third-party apps made by our developer community.

We build point-of-sale apps to help numerous types of merchants run their business – restaurants, retail, salons, hotels, and more. We integrate new types of payments like mobile wallets and QR codes to enable our merchants to sell to international communities. We help merchants build relationships with their customers through instant messaging and loyalty programs. We build dashboards and reporting products to give merchants insight into their business and how they can make it more profitable, more efficient, more fun.

Running a store is hard. We want our smart terminal and the apps that run on it to support our store owners, employees, and their customers as much as possible.

Android projects at Poynt
Build an app that displays your stock count for each inventory item, plus alerts you when you run low on an item. It should automatically sync data between all of your terminals. Bonus points if you can edit stock directly from the app.Create a prototype of a facial recognition payment system that runs OpenCV in a terminal app and charges the customer’s account without them having to take out their wallet.Build a service that allows external systems to communicate with the Poynt terminal over TCP, Bluetooth, or Websockets.Add a Visa screen and jingle after each Visa transaction to improve customer brand awareness (and get showcased at their booth at the Super Bowl).

"Oxide is seeking software engineers at nearly every level of the software stack, from the depths of firmware through the hypervisor, control plane, top-of-rack switch, and higher-level management software.
We are united by a common interest in implementing the systems software that abstracts the machine. You should have an affinity for gnarly systems problems, viewing a software bug as an opportunity to better understand a system rather than an unfortunate incident to be wished away. You are accustomed to demonstrations of your software being underappreciated by the uninitiated, who may just view it as a functioning system rather than an importantly improved one. You've likely done kernel or firmware work, but wherever you have worked in the software stack you have found yourself testing (or being tested by) the limits of the layer beneath you. While we don't specify experience levels with particular languages or tools, you've almost certainly done work in C and assembly - and you have probably started to play with Rust if you haven't already outright fallen in love with it. You know the tools well on the systems that you have used, often being the one to discover their limitations. You appreciate and are inspired by well-written documentation, and try to do your part to continue what can feel like a lost art. You long for a team filled with people similarly motivated working for a company that you can believe in - or pine for a time in your past when you had such a team or worked for such a company.

While the nature of the problems we're solving biases us to those with experience, we are open to engineers at the beginning of their career who feel an exceptional calling to systems software.

Oxide is based in Emeryville, California, but we support remote work as well."
"The Problem

At its core, education has a fundamental data problem: schools run on legacy infrastructure that's impossible for developers to build on top of. We're on a mission to replace the terrible things that engineers have to do to build classroom software (think nightly CSV FTP transfers) with an API that feels more like Facebook's or Stripe's. On the school-facing side, we're looking to become a single place where schools can discover, integrate, and evaluate the dozens of in-class applications they're using.

When we started seven years ago, four schools used Clever. Today, Clever is used by over 78,000 schools, making it the fastest-growing company in education. We're looking for talented engineers who want to help us build Clever into something every school, student, and teacher relies on.

A Day in the Life

Interns at Clever work alongside full-time engineers, improving existing products and creating apps that live on top of Clever. Our very first intern wrote an iPhone app on the Clever platform that spread to over a thousand schools on the day it was released. Another intern wrote an app that let schools provision Google accounts, which now manages over 2 million student and teacher accounts.

Clever is mostly written in Typescript, Javascript, Node.js, and Go.

This is exclusively a summer 2021 (May - August / June - September) opportunity.

Requirements
Must be graduating in or before June 2022. Why is this? Clever only offers internships to college students who will be graduating within 9 months of their internship's completion because we view internships as a path to a full-time offer. The internship program lets us identify and mentor future engineers, while offering the the intern a chance to see what it's like to be part of the Clever team. At the end of the internship, we hope to be able to build on a great summer by extending our interns an offer to come back and join us!
Relevant coursework in computer science.
Past projects demonstrating strong coding ability.
A desire to grow as an engineer through collaboration, code reviews, and learning new languages/technologies.

"About Labelbox

Labelbox is building software infrastructure for industrial data science teams to do data labeling for the training of neural networks. When we build software, we take for granted the existence of collaborative tools to write and debug code. The machine learning workflow has no standard tooling for labeling data, storing it, debugging models and then continually improving model accuracy. Enter Labelbox. Labelbox's vision is to become the default software for data scientists to manage data and train neural networks in the same way that GitHub or text editors are defaults for software engineers.

We are backed by some of the finest people in the Silicon Valley who work at Andreessen Horowitz, Gradient Ventures (Google's AI fund), Kleiner Perkins and First Round Capital.
What you'll be doing
Design and implement features for the Labelbox Platform, which will be used by ML engineering teams to create and manage training data for production AI solutions.
Be actively involved in strategic decisions and product direction.
Work closely with PMs, designers, and engineers to design and iterate over engineering solutions.
Work closely with highly technical Labelbox customers/users to deeply understand their needs and build products that will help accelerate their development of production AI solutions.
Continuously iterate on and improve development processes, and help onboard new team members.
Participate in the Platform on-call rotation, and debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack.
What we value
You are excited about building a highly elegant and intuitive product that ML engineers will use to create and manage training data for production AI solutions.
You have a strong technical background, and a track record of designing and delivering engineering projects/features end-to-end.
You are able to balance owning technical design decisions, soliciting feedback, managing and communicating timelines, and making appropriate tradeoffs between development speed and software robustness/reliability.
You strive to build systems that are robust, yet simple and easy to understand.
You have experience as a generalist, working across the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users.
You apply a constant and committed approach to learning and growing in your art. You believe in applying your craft to practical problems and value having a meaningful impact in an exciting, growing field.
We're looking for someone with
10+ years of experience building production web applications and distributed systems
Experience building scalable web services in either Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, Java or similar language/framework
Experience working with databases, cloud environments, and distributed systems
Experience building elegant and intuitive web applications using React/Redux or similar web frameworks
Experience collaborating closely with PMs and designers

We believe that AI has the power to transform every aspect of our lives - from healthcare to agriculture. The exponential impact of artificial intelligence will mean mammograms can happen quickly and cheaply irrespective of the limited number of radiologists there are in the world and growers will know the instant that disease hits their farm without even being there.

At Labelbox, we’re building a platform to accelerate the development of this future. Rather than requiring companies to create their own expensive and incomplete homegrown tools, we’ve created a training data platform that acts as a central hub for humans to interface with AI. When humans have better ways to input and manage data, machines have better ways to learn.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

"About the Team

The Analytics team is a critical function that supports data-driven decision-making throughout Harry's. In partnership with our Data Engineering team, we make sure that data flows throughout the company, and everyone has the information they need to make better decisions faster. The analytics team thinks about data and insights across our global supply chain, through the marketing we show our customers, to when the customer gets a package at their door or at their nearest retailer.

As Harry's, Inc diversifies across more channels, geographies, and brands, it is becoming increasingly more important that our data tells the story of the entire portfolio in a way that clarifies ROI and tradeoffs for our leaders at all levels of the business.

To support these needs, we are focused on building up our analytics capabilities to support our GMs and Inc leadership team. Responsibilities will span:

Maintaining the analytics layer of our data model in the data warehouse and in our BI tools (i.e., Looker)
Maintaining our metrics and data definitions in a nuanced yet consistent manner across brands to surface insights on business health

Understand how advertising channel mix shift has impacted our customer value over time, and identify strategies for leveraging this knowledge in our business
Measure how an omni-channel campaign created incremental revenue and profit across DTC, Retail, and other third party channels
Help define how we measure and report out on performance, and regularly track and share the overall performance of the business to drive strategic planning
Support the forecasting team in understanding variance vs. prior forecasts
Identify analytics pain points and inefficiencies, and develop new tools and automated process to optimize and streamline
Build requirements for and support the development of the multi-branded codebase (i.e., the data model that sits within the data warehouse) , in collaboration with our analytics engineer and data engineers
Be a data-evangelist across the organization, sharing best practices and insights with cross-functional teams

Engaged Analytical Thought Partner – You are excited about partnering with coworkers to figure out how analytics can solve problems. You are skilled in translating business questions into data analysis visions to execute. You are great at communicating in order to both fully understand someone's business needs and to communicate potential limitations of your approach
Tactical Problem Solver – You have experience boiling down medium and large scope data problems into measurable and achievable blocks of work. You have the foresight to identify and dismantle potential roadblocks ahead of time. Furthermore, you're pragmatic: you can identify and work on the most important problems first and you want to find the highest-impact lowest cost solution
Clear and concise communicator – You know how to communicate complex concepts effectively and concisely and are comfortable presenting and debating in large groups. We're looking for strong data advocates who can plug into cross-functional working teams seamlessly and drive cultural pushes for the organization to become more data driven

Who are you?

You move fast.
You’ve never understood why other engineers take so long to implement features. You were once called a ‘code machine’ and it was a highlight of your career. You feel that done is better than perfect and that it’s best to launch quickly and iterate.

"We Are:

Strateos has developed the first robotic cloud laboratory platform for on-demand life science research by integrating laboratory processes, instruments and IoT technologies into a single user interface. Top ten pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech companies use the platform to conduct efficient, reproducible and rapid experimentation from anywhere in the world. Most recently Strateos has been selected to partner with Eli Lilly to develop and operate an 11,500 square ft fully automated compound synthesis and bioassay system.

We want:

The SCLE [Strateos Common Lab Environment] team is responsible for implementing and maintaining the systems that schedule and dispatch experiments in our automated labs. We are seeking a Backend Engineer to join our dynamic team.

Scheduling is the process of converting a high-level description of an experiment (in the form of Autoprotocol) to a specific plan that can be executed at a particular facility. A single operation specified in Autoprotocol might entail a number of low-level commands that must be issued against multiple devices in the correct order, while the timing of these commands may have to satisfy certain requirements. We formulate a declarative model representing the operational constraints that the protocol must satisfy and then solve it to produce a schedule. Typical experiments we might schedule might have >10,000 variables and constraints, and our goal to find a setting of those variables that both (1) is valid and (2) minimizes the time required to execute the experiment. (The general formulation of most of these scheduling problems is known in the academic literature to be NP-hard, so we need some creative approaches to be able to schedule experiments and to do so reliably!)

Dispatching is the process of taking the execution plan (the schedule) and commanding all the devices in the lab facility to run each step when appropriate until the entire experiment is complete. However, it's famously said that ""no plan survives contact with reality"" and schedules are no exception. An experiment can deviate from its plan in any of a number of ways. Things as disruptive as a device going down, or as common as operations taking shorter or longer than their expected time, all require the system to compensate or replan future tasks on-the-fly to ensure that the scientist's biological intent isn't compromised. The dispatcher exposes a web interface, a dashboard that allows operators to monitor the status of the experiment (and the lab facility) in real time and to intervene if necessary.

SCLE development routinely includes:
defining and implementing support for instructions, constraints and other abstractions that encode new types of scientific intent
ensuring that scheduling (of a diverse set of protocols across a variety of lab hardware configurations) is correct and robust
working with our scientists and operators to identify and define best practices for writing protocols that accurately capture scientific intent while being reliably schedulable
making the system more performant and fault-tolerant and thereby allowing the modeling, scheduling, and dispatching of ever more complex protocols
Our stack

Most SCLE code is in Scala, and we deploy to a combination of hosts that are distributed between AWS and the lab facility itself. The SCLE operator dashboard is a React app in Typescript. The components talk to each other using RabbitMQ.

You Have:
Fluency in at least one major programming language, e.g. Java, C/C++, or Python (Scala is a plus)
Experience implementing distributed systems
Knowledge of UNIX, system administration, networking, etc.
Familiarity with cloud services, primarily AWS
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills; the capability to take a high-level mission and translate it into action with minimal guidance
At least two years of professional experience
Willingness to travel to partner sites
You Want:
A challenging environment that will push you to grow and improve professionally, every day
Opportunities to learn new technologies and fields, along with the freedom to work on hard technology and real science
Competitive salary and meaningful equity
Flexible vacation policy
Medical, dental, and vision insurance
Pre-tax commuter benefits
Monthly gym stipend
Lunch, dinner & unlimited snacks

The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.

We trust our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as collaboration. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and now we're looking to hire another core engineer to help us scale our platform.

As a Software Engineer you will play a central role in building a quality digital closing platform that our partners can trust and use.

You will design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and distributed systems. In addition to contributing to core services, you will contribute to debugging production issues across services, participate in code reviews and arch specs. Your day to day interactions span product and engineering teams to release at a high velocity in all phases of the SDLC. We have a small team so your contributions will have huge impact.

Here is where you come in. Upon completing your BS/BA Computer Science, you joined the industry ready to contribute to a growing business. Now it's time to dive into the startup world and apply your talents to solve real world problems. Over the past 4+ years you have mastered object-oriented programming with at least one of these Ruby, Go, Python, Scala, Java etc working in a production environment. More recently you have been focused on backend development, building APIs, services & working with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc). You have a bias for testing and quality is at the center of your work. Cross functional collaboration is important to you as you are eager to solve a range of problems across the org. Today our team is working in Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres, AWS, Docker, & Kubernetes to name a few but things change quickly so be comfortable learning new tools. We take a pragmatic approach to programming language experience and believe languages can be learned so don't get too hung up if you have not worked with our tools. Hopefully learning new tools & new languages is something you are eager to do.

Snapdocs’ culture is one that strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value independent work as well as collaboration. We provide a slew of excellent benefits ranging from the standard stuff like a matching 401(k), 21 days PTO, work from home wellness reimbursements to the not so standard 10-year exercise window on your options! Once we’re safely back in the offices- which are in the heart of the FiDi in San Francisco and downtown Denver- we’ll still offer flexibility in deciding where, exactly, you work best."

"In 2011 SkySlope started out in the third bedroom of our CEO’s house with just him and two others. Every year since then we’ve experienced insane growth and after growing out of our previous 3 offices we have now settled into our new home in downtown Sacramento only two blocks away from the new arena and right in the heart of the action.

By the power of an amazing product and tons of Red Bull we now have over 225,000 users spread out across 5000 offices nationwide. We’ve been successful because we obsess over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. 8 out of the top 15 Real Estate Brokerages in the nation are currently using software in order to be paperless and all 8 of them use our product. But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. Because of that, in October 2017 we announced that SkySlope will become a part of the Fidelity National Financial (NYSE: FNF) family. This partnership will allow us to not only grow faster than we ever have before, but it will also allow us to build exciting new products for our customers while maintaining the same broker and agent-centric approach that we’ve become known for over the years.

You don't just follow the main use cases and find obvious problems, you are a kung-fu master who combines a keen sense of what developers likely skipped over with an uncanny insight into how real people use an app — and can organize a testing team too. You started your career in development and have a Computer Science degree and/or have spent at least three years in industry doing software testing for mobile products and creating great infrastructure to help tests do more and run faster.
You will work closely with our product team and developers to immerse yourself in the features being dropped into each release. You will review analytics and triage bug reports to determine problems and priorities. You don't mind being the bad-cop when people's test coverage is slipping and you aren't afraid to stand firm when you know quality isn't at the desired level."

Thirty Madison is building the premier healthcare company for people with chronic health issues. Through our novel approach to care delivery, powered by our proprietary platform and brands built around specific chronic conditions, we combine the best of specialist-level healthcare with the convenience of telemedicine.

In just three years, we've built three brands on top of our platform: Keeps (for men's hair loss), Cove (for migraine), and Evens (for acid reflux). We're growing rapidly, recently raised a $47m Series B, and are backed by some of the best healthcare and consumer investors, including Polaris Partners, Johnson & Johnson, Maveron, Northzone, First Round, and Greycroft, among others.

These initiatives have included providing funds for home office improvements, medical reimbursements, free meditation/mindfulness tools, mandatory ""Me Days"" away from work, company-wide days off, and fun opportunities to connect live with teammates each week (such as virtual escape rooms). We continue to examine different benefits, tools, and processes that best support our employees as we continue to work remotely and eventually begin transitioning back to the office.
